 tailwind is nothing , its just node.js package which is used to create css classes for styling the html elements.
 By installing Tailwind as a dev dependency only in npm package, you streamline your production build by not adding tailwind framweork in that, ensuring that only the necessary CSS is shipped â€” making your app faster and more efficient. ðŸš€
 npm install -D tailwindcss    ,-D ensures its onlyy dev dependecny  -->
